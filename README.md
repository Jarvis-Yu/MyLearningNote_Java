# MyLearningNote_Java
Personal learning note of Java Learning, focus mainly on the idea of OOP

All notes are in src/ in packages starting with "no%d%d"

I might make the README nicer if I have time to do so.

## Content

The name of the packages describes the content in it

Classes with the initial 'X' is not a note but something to be used
